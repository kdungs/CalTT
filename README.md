# CalTT
Generate a nice timetable from your Google Calendar.

## Warning
**This code is heavily under development.** Don't expect anything to work yet.

## What's this?
Google Calendar is a pretty nifty thing you might use every day. However when it comes to planning your weekly schedule in school or university you might want something more timetable-ish. This is where CalTT - short for **Cal**endar **T**ime **T**able - comes into play. Since you probably have already put all your relevant events (lectures, tutorials, etc.) in a seperate calendar (e.g. labeled "University"), using CalTT is easily done in four steps:
 * Obtain your calendar's ID (looks something like randommixoflettersanddigits@group.calendar.google.com)
 * Clone this repository
 * _[Generate an OAuth Key](https://code.google.com/apis/console) (For your own safety at this pointâ€¦ Likely to be improved/removed in future versions.)_
 * Run `caltt.py` _(At this point there is no HTML output, yet. This is soon to be added, of course.)_

## Settings
You have to have a `settings.json` file present in the same directory as caltt.py. It should look like the following:
```json
{
    "cal_id": "<YOUR CALENDAR ID>",
    "client_id": "<YOUR APP'S CLIENT ID>",
    "client_secret": "<YOUR APP'S CLIENT SECRET>"
}
```
where you have to replace the values in brackets, of course.
